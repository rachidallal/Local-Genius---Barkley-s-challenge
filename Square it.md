Square it â€“ settle debts and split payments.


The concept of our idea is to make it fair for communities and parties when it comes to spending money collectively. It incorporates a cost sharing and debt settling system as well as a contribution/saving system. 
 
 What is Square it?
 Square it is an app idea that is used for splitting payments and settling debts, aimed to be used by groups consisting of more than two people. Primarily targeted at small-medium communities, like shared housing. As well as small parties, like a group of friends eating out or splitting a cab. 
 
 Our app will be free to use but will require users to create an account and add their payment details. This is so they can send and receive payments. 
 Users can then create and join groups. Group settings can be adjusted to suit their purpose, which will depend on the communities or parties needs. 
 A group for a shared home may want to all contribute equally for communal household items. As well as save up collectively in a shared pot for essentials. Or alternatively use the saved money for an occasional treat or outing. In this case each housemate could be required to automatically contribute a certain amount of money at regular intervals. 
 Group members could also request items when needed and chose to see current offers and deals on these items. Potentially order them with a few taps, or just add them to a shopping list for all housemates to see. All group members must approve an item or a withdrawal before the transaction can be made.
 
 Groups can be made for one time or long term use. They do not have to require regular contributions and can just be for splitting a one off payment. Simply join or create a new group and the person who paid for an item or activity submits a request. This request could be like a form asking what the payment was for, how much it cost, and who will be splitting the cost within the group. The selected members will receive the request and with one click can pay their share. 
 
 We do not believe there are currently any apps that combine the actual splitting and settling of payments and debts, with making note of them. Square it is a community based solution striving to keep you and your group on top of your finances, and more importantly make all of you square.
